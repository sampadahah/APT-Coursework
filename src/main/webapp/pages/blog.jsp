      <p>In 2024, skincare is all about simplicity and sustainability. People are embracing skinimalism with fewer, multi-purpose products. There's a focus on protecting skin from blue light and using products that calm both skin and mind. Eco-friendly packaging is also becoming a must, and maintaining a healthy skin microbiome is gaining importance.</p>

      <p>Pilling occurs when skincare products form small flakes on your skin. It‚Äôs usually caused by layering too many products, applying them too quickly, or using incompatible ingredients. To prevent pilling, use fewer products, apply them in the right order, and let each layer absorb before applying the next.</p>

      <p>A proper skincare routine can help maintain healthy skin. Start with a gentle cleanser to remove dirt and oil. Follow with a toner to balance the skin's pH. Apply a serum for targeted treatment, then moisturize to lock in hydration. Finish with sunscreen to protect from UV damage.</p>

      <p>If your skincare isn't working, it could be due to factors like using the wrong products for your skin type, not applying products in the correct order, or inconsistent use. Other reasons include over-exfoliating, not giving products enough time to work, or using expired products. Make sure to be patient and follow the right routine.</p>

      <p>To ensure your skincare products remain effective, store them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat. Keep them tightly sealed and upright to prevent contamination. For products with active ingredients, such as serums or retinoids, refrigeration may help maintain their potency.</p>

      <p>Stay hydrated by drinking more water to keep your skin plump. Aloe vera can soothe irritated skin, while a honey face mask provides natural moisture. Massaging your face improves circulation, and sleeping on your back helps reduce wrinkles. Simple and effective hacks that cost you nothing!</p>
